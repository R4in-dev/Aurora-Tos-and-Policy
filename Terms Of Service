You agree to use Aurora only for lawful purposes and in a manner that respects the rights of others. You are solely responsible for your actions while using Aurora. Any misuse, abuse, or harmful behavior is strictly prohibited.

2. Data Collection

Aurora may collect and store data related to your use of the bot, including your Discord ID and messages. Important: Messages are only temporarily processed for commands (e.g., image processing with the invert command) and are not stored permanently. Command usage may also be logged for troubleshooting purposes and retained for up to 30 days.

3. User Content

You are fully responsible for any content you upload, share, or transmit via Aurora. You agree not to submit any content that is illegal, harmful, or violates the rights of others.

4. Termination

I reserve the right to restrict or terminate your access to Aurora if I determine that you are abusing the bot, intentionally attempting to exploit it, or violating these terms repeatedly.

5. Intellectual Property

Aurora and all associated trademarks, logos, and intellectual property are owned by me or my licensors. You may not use Aurora or any related intellectual property for commercial purposes without my explicit written consent.

6. Disclaimer of Warranties

Aurora is provided “as is” and without any warranty, express or implied. While I aim to keep Aurora operational and error-free, I do not guarantee uninterrupted service. Scheduled maintenance will be posted on Aurora Status.

7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances shall I be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of Aurora, or any content or data transmitted through it.

8. Dashboard and Privacy Policy

Aurora uses Red-Dashboard for its web interface. While no data leaves my servers to Red-Dashboard, you agree to its Privacy Policy: Red-Dashboard Privacy Policy. For questions, you can contact me on Discord: bencos18.

9. Governing Law

These ToS are governed by the laws of Ireland. Any disputes shall be resolved according to the dispute resolution provisions outlined in the Discord Terms of Service.

10. Changes to the ToS

I reserve the right to update or modify these ToS at any time. Continued use of Aurora following any changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms. Announcements will be made prior to implementing significant updates whenever possible.
